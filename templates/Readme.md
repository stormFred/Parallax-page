# What I Learnt

How to position a div:

```
.section {
	position: absolute;
	margin-top: 210vh;
  ...
}
```

How to set image as background:

```
.three {
  ...
	background: url(../images/photo4.jpeg);
	background-repeat: none;
	background-size: cover;
	background-attachment: fixed;
}
```

# Continued development
